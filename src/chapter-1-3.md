In recent years, there has been a growing interest globally in creating smart cities - cities that leverage technology to improve the lives of their residents, enhance sustainability, and increase economic growth. One crucial element of smart cities is transportation infrastructure, which plays a key role in shaping the livability of urban spaces.

However, conventional transportation infrastructure is struggling with challenges such as traffic congestion, air pollution, and safety issues. To address these challenges, there is a need for intelligent technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI) to be integrated into transportation infrastructure.

AI has the potential to revolutionize the transportation industry, allowing for the creation of efficient, safe, and sustainable transportation systems. For instance, machine learning algorithms can analyze large amounts of data to identify traffic patterns and forecast future traffic flows, enabling real-time traffic management and optimized routing. Similarly, computer vision can be used to monitor traffic and detect accidents, while optimization techniques can plan routes that minimize fuel consumption and emissions.

Furthermore, AI can facilitate the development of autonomous vehicles that have been designed to navigate complex traffic situations and ensure safety. This can lead to more efficient and safer transportation for all, from private cars to public transportation.

In this book, we will explore the various ways in which AI can be used in transportation infrastructure to create more intelligent and sustainable transportation systems. We will examine case studies from around the world, analyzing the success of current projects and identifying areas for further development.

Through this exploration, we hope to demonstrate the need for intelligent technologies in smart cities and the potential applications of AI in improving the quality of life for urbanites. By embracing these technologies, we can work towards creating cities that are both intelligent and sustainable for generations to come.
